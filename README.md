# Machine-failure-prediction
Machine failures can cause significant operational downtime and increased maintenance costs. Predicting failures in advance allows for preventive maintenance and minimizes disruptions. This project aims to develop a machine failure prediction model using logistic regression based on various sensor data inputs.
